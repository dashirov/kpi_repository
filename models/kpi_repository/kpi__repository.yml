      **Model Purpose:**

      The **kpi__repository** model serves as a centralized repository that consolidates key performance indicators (KPIs) from various domains, including acquisition, engagement, and conversion. By unifying these metrics into a single table, this model facilitates comprehensive analysis and reporting across different aspects of the business.

      ---



      1. **Data Aggregation:**

         - The model uses the `dbt_utils.union_relations` macro to combine data from multiple source models into a single table.
         - The source models included are:

           - **Acquisition KPIs:**
             - `kpi__acquisition__registrations`
             - `kpi__acquisition__active_registered_users`
             - `kpi__acquisition__new_users`
             - `kpi__acquisition__resurrected_users`
             - `kpi__acquisition__store_rank`
             - `kpi__acquisition__trial_starts`

           - **Conversion KPIs:**
             - `kpi__conversion__registration_to_trial_conversion_rate`
             - `kpi__conversion__trial_to_premium_conversion_rate`
             - `kpi__conversion__trial_vs_direct`
             
           - **Engagement KPIs:**
             - `kpi__engagement__active_food_users`
             - `kpi__engagement__consecutive_food_users`
             - `kpi__engagement__average_daily_active_registered_users`
             - `kpi__engagement__initial_food_users_part_1`
             - `kpi__engagement__initial_food_users_part_2`

           - **Retention KPIs:**
             - `kpi__retention__eop_premium_subscribers`
             - `kpi__fpna__premium_subscription_renewal_rate_pn_over_pn_minus_one`
             - `kpi__retention__subscription_renewals`

      2. **Columns Included:**

         - The columns selected from each source model are:

           - `id`: A unique identifier for each record.
           - `indicator`: The name of the metric.
           - `cycle`: The reporting period (e.g., 'week').
           - `dimensions`: A JSON object containing dimension attributes (e.g., geography, platform).
           - `cycle_timestamp`: The timestamp representing the start of the reporting cycle.
           - `value`: The value of the metric.

      3. **Column Overrides:**

         - The `VALUE` column's data type is overridden to `NUMBER(18,4)` for consistency across different metrics.
         - The `CYCLE_TIMESTAMP` column's data type is set to `TIMESTAMP_NTZ` (timestamp without time zone).

      4. **Data Union:**

         - The `dbt_utils.union_relations` macro efficiently unions all the specified models by aligning the selected columns and applying the column overrides.
         - This results in a unified table that contains all the KPIs with consistent data types and column structures.

      5. **Considerations:**

         - **Data Consistency:**
           - Ensures that all source models have compatible data types for the included columns to prevent errors during the union operation.
         - **Scalability:**
           - As new KPIs are developed, they can be easily added to the repository by including them in the `relations` list within the `dbt_utils.union_relations` macro.
         - **Performance:**
           - The model is materialized as a table to optimize query performance when accessing the aggregated KPIs.

      ---

      By consolidating KPIs from various domains into the **kpi__repository** model, analysts and stakeholders can access a comprehensive set of metrics from a single source. This facilitates cross-functional analysis, simplifies reporting processes, and enhances the ability to track business performance holistically.
