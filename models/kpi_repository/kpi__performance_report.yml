      **Model Purpose:**

      The **kpi__performance_report** model generates a comprehensive performance report by consolidating and enriching KPI data from the `kpi__repository`. It provides current and prior period values for key metrics, enabling year-over-year comparisons and trend analysis. This model is essential for stakeholders who require insights into business performance over time.

      Parameters

          reporting_period
            Defines the granularity at which KPI measurements are grouped and compared.
              
            Acceptable values: 'day', 'week', 'month', 'quarter', or 'year'.
            Default: `'week'
          
            Effect on Execution:  
              * Determines how 'cycle' and 'cycle_timestamp' are truncated in the joined KPI repository data.
              * Drives the offset logic for prior period lookups (e.g., matching last yearâ€™s same week if 'week' or 'bi-week').
          
          anchor_date
            A reference date used to identify the last complete reporting period.
            
            Acceptable values: a date string in ISO format ('YYYY-MM-DD')
            Default: current date in ISO format

            Effect on Execution:  
              * If the model runs incrementally, data is loaded only up to the cycle timestamp that ends before this anchor date.
              * Prevents partial or future periods from appearing in the final output, focusing exclusively on fully closed intervals.

          backfill_mode
            Specifies whether to bypass incremental constraints to allow full historical data loads.
            
            Acceptable Values: true/false boolean value
            Default: false

            Effect on Execution:  
              * If 'true', the model ignores the normal incremental filter, reprocessing historical data in the repository.
              * If 'false', it solely updates the last complete reporting period (and matching prior offsets), improving performance and avoiding partial data ingestion.

      **Methodology:**

      This model generates a **Performance Report** by consolidating **current** and **prior** KPI measurements from the `kpi__repository` and optionally matching them to AOP (Annual Operating Plan) targets. It allows direct comparisons across periods, plus an indication of how results align with planned goals.

      1. **Current and Prior Measurements:**
         - **`current_measurements`:**
           - Pulls KPI measurements for the last complete `reporting_period` (or beyond if `backfill_mode=true`).
           - Each record includes the metric (`indicator`), dimensional breakdown (`dimensions`), and a numeric `value` to be renamed `current_value`.
         - **`prior_measurements`:**
           - Extracts comparable data from the `kpi__repository` for the corresponding prior period:
             - For weekly cycles, matches the same week in the previous year (or `'bi-week'` logic).
             - For monthly/quarterly/yearly cycles, offsets by exactly one year from the cycle timestamp.
           - Provides a `value` that becomes `prior_value` after the join.

      2. **AOP Targets:**
         - If an AOP table exists (`kpi__aop_targets`), each relevant record is joined on `(cycle_timestamp, cycle, indicator, dimensions)` to yield `plan` as `aop_value`.
         - If the table is missing or no matching plan is found, `aop_value` remains `NULL`.

      3. **Merging Data (`measurements_with_prior` CTE):**
         - **Left Join** merges current measurements, AOP data, and prior measurements on the same dimension set.
         - Uses `ROW_NUMBER()` to keep only the best prior match (i.e., the latest preceding cycle).
         - Labels the final metrics as:
           - **`current_value`**: The latest measured KPI in the cycle.
           - **`prior_value`**: The KPI from the matching prior cycle.
           - **`aop_value`**: The planned or targeted goal from the AOP table.

      4. **Final Output:**
         - Constructs `metric` and `coordinates` strings from dimension keys and values for readability.
         - Determines a `sortkey` for convenient ordering by cycle type (day=0, week=1, etc.) plus the numerical date portion.
         - Generates a `label` field (e.g., `'W-52'`, `'Jan 2024'`) for user-friendly period identification.
         - Uses `dbt_utils.generate_surrogate_key` to form a unique `alt_id`.

      ---

      **Considerations for Data Accuracy:**

      - **Incremental Operation:**
        - Default logic includes only the last complete `reporting_period` in the final dataset unless `backfill_mode=true`.
        - Minimizes partial future data from polluting the current KPIs.
      - **Consistency in Dimensions:**
        - Mismatches between current and prior data for `dimensions` lead to fewer matched rows.
      - **Date Alignment:**
        - For weekly cycles, the model matches the same week number one year prior. For monthly or quarterly, subtracts exactly one year from the cycle_timestamp.
      - **AOP Presence:**
        - If `kpi__aop_targets` is absent or no matching record is found, `aop_value` stays `NULL`.
      - **Partial Period Caution:**
        - If the anchor_date is mid-period, ensure you understand that partial data is excluded to avoid incomplete results.

      By merging current measurements, prior comparisons, and optional AOP targets, **`kpi__performance_report`** 
      provides a unified view of KPI trends over time and in relation to annual planning goals. Adjusting **`
      reporting_period`, `anchor_date`, and `backfill_mode`** modifies the time window and data coverage to match 
      our analytic and historical data needs.
